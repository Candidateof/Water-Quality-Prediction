# Water-Quality-Prediction
The project is about determining and predicting the water quality using ML and AI algorithms

---

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters
The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

- NH4

- BOD5 (BSK5)

- Colloids

- O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and

- CL

---
## Technologies Used
* Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

* Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation

* Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

* Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation

---

## Model Performance
The model was evaluated using:

- R² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Performance was acceptable across all parameters
